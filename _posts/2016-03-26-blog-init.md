In the ever long quest to better myself, I've decided to start personal blog. 

## Why Blog?
When thinking about starting a blog, I could think of more reasons to **not** create one. This list is not at all inclusive or logical, but here's a bit of where my mind was.

- Too many damn options
    + Creating a personal blog is easier than ever these days, but the problem I faced was to find a platform that hit all of my requirements. A few platforms I looked into: [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/), [Ghost](https://ghost.org/), [Medium](https://medium.com/), [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- To create a *quality blog* I'd need to be a good writer
    + ...with good ideas
    + Do I have those?
- Everyone else is doing it
    + Not that I'm claiming to be a hipster or anything, I just couldn't think of any educational value I'd add to the blogosphere that people weren't doing already.

So what changed?

I was having a conversation with someone I deeply admire the other day. He mentioned that I shouldn't view blogging as a chore, instead I should treat it as a thought exercise. I thought a lot about that. I had spent so much time thinking of the negatives, that I hadn't really considered the pros I could get from blogging. The ability to help others, to learn, to interact; these greatly outweigh the cons. I'm excited to see where this goes. I'm excited to have my thoughts propel into the universe, to have something exist outside of me.
