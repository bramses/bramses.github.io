I've been working in Javascript for a little over a year now. Over this time, I've learned a lot about the language, about the web, and I've come across a lot of libraries. Some of these libraries were useful, others weren't so much. But the one library that I've used without fail in every JS project I've started is [LoDash](https://lodash.com/). 

For those who are unfamiliar, LoDash (like Underscore, and a few others) is a utility library. It works very much like a swiss army knife, allowing for developers to mix and match utility functions to their liking. In the line of work I'm in, these utility functions come in handy __constantly__. From simple straightforwad functions like `_.trim()` to more complex functions like `_.reduce()` or `_.partial()`, LoDash comes in to save the day on so many occasions.

The top three reasons why LoDash is so useful in my opinion (and why you should use it if you're not!):
1. It makes your code much less error prone
2. It increases readibility and cohesion across your codebase
3. It's maintained by a fantastic community

But don't just take my word for it! Look at the number of times LoDash was downloaded on npm in the past [month](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash).

I can't recommend this library highly enough, and everytime I write using other languages like Java, Dart, or Python, I always find myself missing the power and flexibility of LoDash.
