title: One Year with Javascript -- The Ups and Downs
comments: True
---

It was around a year ago that I started using Javascript. Before then, I had assumed that Javascript was just used to write scripts for websites. My knowledge effectively stopped with some basic jQuery. But after inheriting an Angular project at work, I quickly had to learn all I could about Javascript.

Summary: 
* Javascript is a language that has very fast velocity -- it's easy to use it as a scripting language or as a language for a full project
* Javascript can be fast when used right!
* Javascript won't error out until runtime -- debugging is generally tougher
* The ecosystem changes extremely rapidly and there's no clear direction as to where the language is going
