Hi, I'm Bram. Currently, I'm a Compuer Science student studying at the University of Rochester. My academic intrests lie in Machine Learning and Data Science.

I plan to use this space to mainly discuss my intrests in technology, but I'd love to be able to explore other fields as well. :)


I intend to come at this with an approach of 3 parts learning, and 1 part comedic relief.
